# TypeScript

TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. TypeScript offers all of JavaScriptâ€™s features, and an additional layer on top of these. This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.
